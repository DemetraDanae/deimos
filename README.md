# deimos
deimos, is a computational methodology for optimal grouping, applied on the read-across prediction of engineered nanomaterialsâ€™ (NMs) toxicity-related properties. The method is based on the formulation and the solution of a mixed-integer optimization program (MILP) problem that automatically and simultaneously
performs feature selection, defines the grouping boundaries according to the response variable and develops linear regression models in each group. For each group/region, the characteristic centroid is defined in order to allocate untested NMs to the groups. The deimos MILP problem is integrated in a broader optimization workflow that selects the best performing methodology between the standard multiple linear regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models and the proposed deimos multiple-region model. This method can be applied to property prediction of other than NM chemical entities and it is not limited to NMs toxicity prediction.

# Datasets
The deimos methodology is demonstrated on two publicly available datasets: 
<ul>
<li>The first one (Gold ENMs), presented by Walkey <i>et al</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/nn406018q">2014</a>) and filtered by Varsou <i>et al</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00160">2017</a>) using toxFlow. 
<li>The second dataset (MeOx ENMs) is included in the study of Forest <i>et al</i>. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-019-4541-2">2019</a>).
</ul>
